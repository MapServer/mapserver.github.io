MS RFC 112: Retry "Follow" label positioning after maxoverlapangle colision 
============================================================================

:Date:  2014/10
:Author: Thomas Bonfort
:Contact: thomas.bonfort@gmail.com
:Status: Implemented
:Version: MapServer 7.2

1. The Current Situation
========================

The current algorithm used to place "FOLLOW" labels has the following limitations:

- When two subsequent caracters of the label have a relative angle that is over
  the defined "maxoverlapangle", the label is unconditionally discarded.
- The function used to compute character positions relies on "gotos" that
  interrupt the code flow
- Placement of repeated labels works optimally for odd number of repetitions
  only when using repeatdistance, i.e. even if there's room for two labels,
  only one will be rendered

2. Proposed enhancement
=======================

- The algorithm will be extended to account for and try to correct for
  colisions happening when maxoverlapangle kicks in, by ensuring that such
  colisions may only occur between words:

  - collisions hapenning on a 'space' character will be ignored
  - when a colision does occur, the label placement will be retried with an
    offset placed such that the colision falls either on a space or at the
    beginning or end of the string.

- Code will be refactored to avoid usage of gotos

- The placement algorithm will be modified to optimally treat an even number of
  label repetitions:

 - before:

  ::

   -------label--------

 - after:
  
  ::

   --label------label--

2.1 Questions/Limitations
=========================

- Should the retrying behavior be enabled by default, and/or can it be
  deactivated ? Computing and testing a retried offset is not costly, the
  impact in terms of performance should be minimal and will result in more
  labels being placed.
- Should the maximum allowed offset be configurable?  Seems unnecessary for the
  time being, all the relevant info as to what the maximum offset can be is contained
  by the line length, label length, and repeatdistance. 

2.2 Backwards Compatibility
===========================

None expected aside from the fact created maps may contain more/different labels
than beforehand.

2.3 Performance Implications
============================

Limited. Retrying a label after a colision is not a cpu-heavy operation. Costly 
operations such as computing glyph advances and/or shaping text runs are not
re-run for each retry.
