 ESRI Shapefiles (SHP)
*****************************************************************************

Also known as just 'Shapefiles', or ESRI ArcView Shapefiles.  Esri is the software 
company that introduced this format.  ArcView was the first product to use 
shapefiles.

File listing
------------

Shapefiles are made up of a minimum of three similarly named files, with different suffixes::

	Countries_area.dbf
	Countries_area.shp
	Countries_area.shx

Data Access / Connection Method
---------------------------------

Shapefile access is built directly into MapServer.  It is also available 
through OGR, but direct access without OGR is recommended and discussed here. 
The path to the shapefile is required (relative to the SHAPEPATH).  Specifying 
the ".shp" extension is recommended. Shapefiles only hold one layer of data, 
therefore no distinction needs to be made (as is required for other OGR vector 
formats that can contain many layers).

OGRINFO Examples
--------------------

* The directory can serve as a data source.
* Each shapefile in a directory serves as a layer.
* A shapefile can also be a data source.  In this case the layer has the 
  same prefix as the shapefile.

Using ogrinfo on a directory with multiple shapefiles::

	> ogrinfo /data/shapefiles/
    
        INFO: Open of `/data/shapefiles/'
        using driver `ESRI Shapefile' successful.
        1: wpg_h2o (Line String)
        2: wpg_roads (Line String)
        3: wpg_roads_dis (Line String)
        4: wpgrestaurants (Point)

Using ogrinfo on a single shapefile::

	> ogrinfo /data/shapefiles/Countries_area.shp
    
        Had to open data source read-only.
        INFO: Open of `Countries_area.shp'
        using driver `ESRI Shapefile' successful.
        1: Countries_area (Polygon)

Using ogrinfo to examine the structure of the file/layer::

	> ogrinfo -summary /data/shapefiles/Countries_area.shp Countries_area
    
        Had to open data source read-only.
        INFO: Open of `Countries_area.shp'
        using driver `ESRI Shapefile' successful.
