MS RFC 129: Update msautotest to use Pytest
=========================================================================

:Status: Adopted
:Last update: 2020-01-29
:Version: MapServer 7.6

Overview
--------

This RFC proposes to use the `Pytest <https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/>`_
framework, to replace the current ad-hoc Python testing infrastructure for its
msautotest regression test suite.

Rationale
---------

MapServer uses a ad-hoc Python testing infrastructure, similar to what GDAL used
up to GDAL 2.3 (starting with GDAL 2.4, pytest has been adopted)

While it is fullyfunctional, it is non-standard. Using a standard
testing framework brings more familiarity to developers, more capabilities, and
less boilerplate for tests under msautotest/mspython, due to the ability
of using assertions instead of the adhoc post_reason()/return 'fail' current
combo.

Pytest offers, among many other features:

- nicer output
- ability to run a subset of tests based on expressions. For example,
  "pytest -k wfs" to run all tests containing wfs in their name.
- standard solution for skipping tests, expected failures, etc.
- adding custom options with documentation

Proposed solution
-----------------

Tests under msautotest/mspython are modified to be compatible of pytest:
methods are prefixed with `test_`, adhoc post_reason()/return 'fail' replaced
by simple `assert` statements

msautotest/pymod/mstestlib.py, the workhorse to run tests based on mapfiles,
is modified to use pytest infrastructure

Python mapscript tests, under mapscript/python/tests, are not modified. They
use Python `unittest` module, which can be used transparently with pytest.

It is now possible to just run `pytest` from msautotest to run all tests.
Or `pytest misc renderers` to just run tests in those directories.

Backwards Compatibility Issues
-------------------------------

None for users.

What is not changed:

- the syntax of test MapFiles is not changed
- the current run_test.py launcher scripts in wxs/, gdal/, etc. subdirectories
  are preserved and are wrapper scripts over pytest.

A few changes:

- pytest must be installed: "pip install -r requirements.txt" from msautotest/
- a few changes in options: the strict, valgrind and run_under_asan options are
  now prefixed with double hyphen

Security implications
---------------------

None

MapScript implications
----------------------

None

Documentation needs
-------------------

https://mapserver.org/development/tests/autotest.html will be updated
